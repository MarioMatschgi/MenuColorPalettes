MenuColorPalettes is structured in color-palettes and colors.
* ColorPalettes: ColorPalettes are - as the name suggests - groups of colors
    * ColorPalettes can be imported from websites.
        > Currently the only website supported is [flatuicolors.com](https://flatuicolors.com)
    * ColorPalettes pop out into a seperate window which floats above everything so you can access your colors easily
* Colors: Colors are defined with a name and contain a color
    * Colors can be copied in many different formats ("r, g, b", "r, g, b, a", "hex" and more)

    For FlatUIColors: Go to your FlatUIColors palette. Next view the page sourcecode (Process differs for different browsers) by right-clicking and choosing something like "view element" or "element information" or "view source". Then copy the HTML code of the div with the class "colors" - thats the code you have to paste into the text-field "FlatUIColors code".
